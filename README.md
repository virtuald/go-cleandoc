go-cleandoc
===========

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/virtuald/go-cleandoc?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/virtuald/go-cleandoc)

Provides an implementation of python's `inspect.cleandoc` in golang. There's
probably a builtin that already does this, but I couldn't find it, so here
we are.
